name: translation-quality
description: |
  Use this skill whenever the user asks for a non-trivial translation, transcript translation, annual-report or financial-report translation, financial/earnings-call translation, blog-ready translation, or review/revision of an existing Korean translation. It preserves source structure while producing natural Korean, applies the user's preferred formatting, and requires a full-document QA pass before delivery.

# Translation Quality

This skill defines the user's expected translation workflow and output standard. It applies even when the user does not ask for a blog-ready file. The goal is a deliverable that can be pasted or published with minimal cleanup.

## Core Standard

1. Translate meaning, not English syntax. Korean must read like polished Korean business prose, not a literal transcript.
2. Preserve the original document's information, order, structure, emphasis, links, and explanatory context.
3. Do not treat the first draft as final. Conceptual review and full-document QA are mandatory for non-trivial work.
4. Do not rely on the user to catch translationese, source omissions, numeric drift, or publication defects.
5. If a term needs explanation, place the note at the first occurrence and record its basis in QA.
6. Prefer deterministic, copy-paste-safe HTML when rich formatting or long-document navigation matters.
7. The final standard is a reader-facing Korean document, not an extraction dump or an internal QA artifact.

## Staged Reference Loading

Use progressive disclosure. Do not load every rule for every document.

1. Read `references/core.md` for every non-trivial translation or revision. It contains the portable reader contract, common workflow, style, notes, HTML, conceptual review, and shared QA gates.
2. Choose one primary document profile during intake:
   - `references/profiles/transcript.md` for earnings calls, interviews, Q&A, interpreted calls, or any speaker-driven document.
   - `references/profiles/report.md` for annual reports, audit reports, prospectuses, financial statements, governance reports, or page/table-heavy formal documents.
3. Load both profiles only when the source genuinely combines both contracts. Record the primary profile and any secondary profile in `work/qa_report.md`.
4. For long, quality-sensitive, or reference-matching work, also read `references/quality_benchmark.md`.
5. Resolve all bundled resources relative to this `SKILL.md` first. The default installed root is `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/translation-quality`.

## Execution Contract

1. State the task objective and completion conditions in one sentence.
2. Identify the source, document type, primary profile, output format, and reader-visible metadata.
3. Trace the source-to-output flow and discover task-local evaluators before editing.
4. For sources longer than roughly 3,000 words, create source units, chunk files, a progress ledger, and a QA report under `work/`.
5. Translate and save reviewable chunks; do not simulate chunking by generating one monolithic translation and splitting it afterward.
6. Assemble the final deliverable deterministically under `outputs/`.
7. Run conceptual review with the reviewer named by the selected profile, then run mechanical and source-fidelity QA.
8. Fix accepted findings, rerun the closest affected checks, and verify the final file itself before delivery.

## Completion Gates

Do not claim completion until all applicable gates pass or a concrete limitation is disclosed:

1. source coverage and order
2. selected profile contract
3. natural Korean and communicative role
4. financial number, unit, fiscal-period, and repeated-guidance fidelity
5. note basis and first-occurrence placement
6. structure, links, emphasis semantics, and HTML invariants
7. conceptual reviewer ledger
8. applicable helper and task-local evaluator results
9. final output existence and file sanity
10. clear separation of verification, approval, and publication readiness

## Resource Map

- `references/core.md`: shared workflow and quality contract loaded for every non-trivial task
- `references/profiles/transcript.md`: speaker flow, interpreted speech, earnings-call language, and transcript QA
- `references/profiles/report.md`: page/section hierarchy, tables, legal/reporting labels, and equivalence evidence
- `references/quality_benchmark.md`: portable acceptance benchmark and bad-to-target examples
- `agents/korean_translation_reviewer.md`: conceptual reviewer for speaker-driven documents
- `agents/korean_report_reviewer.md`: conceptual reviewer for formal reports
- `scripts/qa_html_translation.py`: HTML, source-artifact, style-template, and numeric QA helper
- `scripts/evaluate_report_equivalence.py`: report structure and reference-equivalence evaluator
- `scripts/merge_chunks.py`, `scripts/md_to_html.py`: deterministic long-document assembly helpers

## Final Response

1. State what was delivered and where.
2. Name the primary profile and concrete QA checks performed.
3. List skipped checks, reasons, and residual risk.
4. If a browser file is already open, tell the user to refresh the existing tab.
5. Do not overclaim perfection or publication approval.
